## Overview and Origin
**Coinbase** is a digital currency exchange headquartered in San Francisco, California. They broker exchanges of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, Tezos, and many others, with fiat currencies in approximately 32 countries, and bitcoin transactions and storage in 190 countries worldwide.

It was founded in **Jun 2012** by **Brian Armstrong** and Fred Ehrsam. Coinbase is headquartered in San Francisco, California. It's current CEO is Brian Armstrong
Subsidiaries of Coinbase include Kippt, Blockspring, Earn.com, Memo.AI.

Today, Coinbase operates in 32 countries and can be divided into four primary lines of business:
- Coinbase
- GDAX
- Custody
- Toshi

### The Idea, Founding & Funding
The idea of Coinbase was based on the logic that anyone, anywhere should be able to easily and securely access Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency will be the future of money and a catalyst for creating an open financial system around the world.

Coinbase was founded in June 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam. Blockchain.info co-founder Ben Reeves was part of the original founding team but later parted ways with Armstrong due to a difference in how the Coinbase wallet should operate. The remaining founding team enrolled in the Summer 2012 Y Combinator startup incubator program. In October 2012, the company launched the services to buy and sell bitcoin through bank transfers. In May 2013, the company received a US$5 million Series A investment led by Fred Wilson from the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures. In December 2013, the company received a US$25 million investment, from the venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures (USV), and Ribbit Capital.

In 2014, the company grew to one million users, acquired the blockchain explorer service Blockr and the web bookmarking company Kippt, secured insurance covering the value of bitcoin stored on their servers, and launched the vault system for secure bitcoin storage. Throughout 2014, the company also formed partnerships with Overstock, Dell, Expedia, Dish Network, and Time Inc. allowing those firms to accept bitcoin payments. The company also added bitcoin payment processing capabilities to the traditional payment companies Stripe, Braintree, and PayPal.

In January 2015, the company received a US$75 million investment, led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson, the New York Stock Exchange, USAA, and several banks. Later in January, the company launched a U.S.-based bitcoin exchange for professional traders called Coinbase Exchange. Coinbase began to offer services in Canada in 2015, but in July 2016, Coinbase announced it would halt services in August after the closure of their Canadian online payments service provider Vogogo.

In May 2016, the company rebranded the Coinbase Exchange, changing the name to Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX). In July 2016, they added retail support for Ether. In January and then March 2017, Coinbase obtained the BitLicense and licensed to trade in Ethereum and Litecoin from the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS). In November 2017, Coinbase was ordered by the US Internal Revenue Service to report any users who had at least $20,000 in transactions in a year. Coinbase listed Bitcoin Cash on December 19, 2017 and the coinbase platform experienced price abnormalities that led to an insider trading investigation. On February 23, 2018, Coinbase told approximately 13,000 affected customers that the company would be providing their taxpayer ID, name, birth date, address, and historical transaction records from 2013 to 2015 to the IRS within 21 days. On April 5, 2018, Coinbase announced that it has formed an early-stage venture fund, Coinbase Ventures, focused on investment into blockchain- and cryptocurrency-related companies.

Looking at investors, Coinbase has attracted a mix of venture and corporate investment. In total, Coinbase has raised $217M in six equity financings since 2012 (including its seed round, not shown on the above graphic). Brand-name venture investors — Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz got in early, and have continued to participate in funding rounds to the company.  

Large financial institutions, like the NYSE and USAA, were part of the company’s $75M Series C in January 2015. According to an NYSE press release, the Series C investment helped “[support] Coinbase’s growth utilizing [NYSE’s] global distribution capabilities and market expertise.” Indeed, Coinbase would launch the “Coinbase Exchange” geared toward professional investors in the same month. This would later rebrand to the “Global Digital Asset Exchange,” or GDAX. In November 2015, USAA partnered with Coinbase to allow their customers to monitor their crypto asset wallet balances when they log into their USAA accounts.
Also, of note, Japanese players Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ and NTT DoCoMo contributed to Coinbase’s Series C-III in July 2016. At the time, Coinbase said it would look to expand into the Japanese market, however this expansion has yet to happen

## Business Activities  

Coinbase was founded to solve the problem of intermediate financial institutions like banks for any finance transactions between two entities or persons thereby trying to achieve an open financial system around the world.  

Coinbase’s customers typically fall into one of two groups: 
- investors, and 
- those transacting with crypto assets.   

For investors, Coinbase encourages transferring funds into its “cold storage” vaults, which it guarantees against Coinbase hacking. These vaults are disconnected from the internet and offer increased security. 
For those transacting (or trading on other exchanges), Coinbase allows users to send funds from Coinbase to other wallets.

Institutional investors — hedge funds, asset managers, and pension funds among them — have expressed interest in crypto assets as their overall value climbed this past year.

Market size includes investor community across the world. Currently it has around 35 million users enrolled with a trading of about 220 Billion in 100+ countries and 7 billion worth of assets

None of Coinbase’s competitor’s exchanges mentioned have strong mobile presences, and only a couple offer brokerage services. Coinbase’s competitors for the most part operate order book exchanges and cater to more experienced traders. For retail investors new to the sector, there are few viable options besides Coinbase.
While Coinbase remains focused on its core brokerage and exchange businesses, one of the company’s longer-term projects is Toshi. Toshi is a mobile app for browsing decentralized applications, an ethereum wallet, and an identity and reputation management system. At a high level, the aim with Toshi is to give users broader access to decentralized applications built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. In this way, Coinbase hopes that Toshi could allow for the building of viable crypto use cases, beyond speculation.
Coinbase has soared in popularity and turned itself into the on ramp for mainstream crypto investors by positioning itself as a safe harbor among crypto asset exchanges. The company has never been hacked, unlike many of its competitors. Coinbase has also maniacally pursued compliance with existing regulations and law enforcement, putting it on the right side of the law — another huge asset in a sector that is still in desperate need of regulatory guidance.
FROM CURRENCY TO INVESTMENT
Where bitcoin and other cryptoassets were once considered a “means of exchange” and an alternative payments system, they are now more often called a “store of value” and an investment opportunity.
SECURITY
Although cryptoassets themselves are quite secure, exchanges have a long history of hacks, exit scams, and lost funds. The most well-known hacked exchange was Mt. Gox, which lost 850,000 bitcoins to hackers in early 2014, worth $450M at the time. Today (in early January 2018), those coins would be worth close to $10B. Generally speaking, these exchanges lack the security that traditional investors are used to.
Coinbase is the exception to this rule. Coinbase has continued to make security a top priority, and it’s paid off. The company has operated since 2012 and has never been hacked, establishing significant trust with consumers.
Investments and funds are held and insured by Coinbase, with the majority of cryptoassets stored offline in cold storage vaults, and the remainder insured by Lloyd’s of London. Funds held in USD wallets on Coinbase are covered by the FDIC and insured up to $250,000.
Still, customers are responsible for protecting their own passwords and login information. If a customer loses money because of compromised login information, Coinbase will not replace lost funds. Coinbase recommends that customers turn on two-factor authentication and place funds into cold storage in order to thwart would-be hackers.
REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
As mentioned, exchanges that handle fiat-cryptoasset trading pairs (e.g. BTC/USD, BTC/GBP) are the primary consumer on-ramps to cryptoassets. Cryptoassets have a history of use in the black market, first with bitcoin, and now with privacy-focused coins, like monero and zcash. Coupled with the sector’s nascency, regulatory bodies have struggled to define, legislate, and tax cryptoassets.
In this regard, Coinbase has differentiated itself from other exchanges by spending substantially on licenses and compliance. Coinbase has made a point of complying with state-by-state money transmission laws, and is one of a few companies to hold a New York Virtual Currency License, or “BitLicense.” A common critique of the BitLicense is its prohibitive cost; over ten companies moved their headquarters from New York to other locales in 2015 after the license was announced.
Other regulations that Coinbase complies with include registration as a Money Services Business with FinCEN, and the Bank Secrecy Act and Patriot Act. Coinbase operates its exchange in 32 countries, including the UK and Switzerland, as mentioned. According to the company, “no license is required to operate a digital currency business in any other country [outside of the US] where Coinbase operates.”
Taken as a whole, Coinbase’s focus on compliance offers safety and assurance for consumers and regulators alike.
RELATIONSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT
Similarly, Coinbase has cooperated heavily with law enforcement. Coinbase follows strict identity verification procedures to comply with regulations like KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (anti-money laundering), and to track and monitor cryptoassets sent to and from its site.
As touched upon earlier, the company complies with the Bank Secrecy Act, which the company says “requires Coinbase to verify customer identities, maintain records of currency transactions for up to 5 years, and report certain transactions,” and the Patriot Act, which has famously been criticized for making it easier for the US government to intercept people’s phone conversations.

Coinbase is therefore a boon for regulators and law enforcement in deciphering decentralized black market activity. Blockchain tracking companies, like Chainalysis, work with Coinbase (and other exchanges) to assist in AML enforcement. As US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin put it in a recent interview: “If you have a wallet to own bitcoins, that company has the same obligation as a bank to know [you as a customer, and] we can track those activities.”
At the same time, Coinbase has pushed back against what it sees as government overreach. In one public instance, the IRS requested customers’ records for the period between 2013-2015. November 2017 court documents from the case nicely summarize the dispute: “That only 800 to 900 taxpayers reported gains related to bitcoin in each of the relevant years and that more than 14,000 Coinbase users have either bought, sold, sent, or received at least $20,000 worth of bitcoin in a given year suggests that many Coinbase users may not be reporting their bitcoin gains.”
Coinbase refused to hand over records, and ultimately won a partial victory in court by reducing the number of customers and scope of data provided. The company has since agreed to give the IRS records on 14,000 users, a somewhat unsatisfactory outcome for Coinbase users with strong privacy concerns.

EASE-OF-USE
In addition to its security and regulatory compliance, Coinbase’s user interface and mobile application have helped the company position itself as the de-facto US crypto asset brokerage. In comparison to earlier iterations, Coinbase’s current user experience is simple, clean, and well-suited for crypto asset retail investors.
Most notable is Coinbase’s mobile app. A testament to the company’s brand, it was the most downloaded app on Apple’s App Store in early December 2017. Coinbase also currently sits at No. 5 for most downloaded US “Finance” apps. No other crypto asset exchange comes close, and few legitimate crypto asset exchange apps are even deployed.
It is unlikely that bitcoin would ever have hit the mainstream without a company like Coinbase, which provides an easy-to-use, trusted means of buying and selling crypto assets.
THE COINBASE EFFECT
All these factors — strong security, regulatory compliance, ease-of-use, and a focus on investment — have enabled Coinbase to emerge as something of a crypto asset kingmaker for investors.

The code for the API(s) are in Node.js and Ruby.
I did not do anything special to find this out, I just entered github.com/coinbase to see what would happen… and it turns out they have a bunch of repositories.
The top language in the repositories is Ruby.
Geoengineer, as they call it, is a Ruby command line tool that codes plans and executes them on their cloud service. I thought that was pretty cool, you can find the repository here: coinbase/geoengineer.
The GDAX API is written in Node.js, as well as the Coinbase API. I have actually dealt with this code as I am working on a trading bot for the crypto markets, and it seems as if GDAX is pretty clean API wise.
Some other interesting repositories they have are: encrypting Bitcoin and other crypto private keys to be less susceptible to brute force attacks: coinbase/bip38, and a Reddit tip bot: coinbase/bittip.

## Landscape

Coinbase falls under the Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies domain of FinTech
Blockchain is the rising technology solutions that have received worldwide attention. Blockchain is a type of digitalized, decentralized ledger providing secure cryptocurrency transfer. This technology allows the users to record and share a common view of a system’s state across a distributed network (peer-to-peer or P2P ledger system). The Blockchain technology enables the value transfer/cryptocurrency and makes the online payment more secure and safer than the traditional payment system

Bitcoin (BTC) technology is the recent FinTech invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 as an open source decentralized digital currency. It is a peer-to-peer (P2P) currency that transcends national boundaries to revolutionize the global payment system

Coinbase and GDAX face direct competition from several fiat-crypto asset exchanges. Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Kraken, and recent entrant to the US market bitFlyer are Coinbase’s main competitors, although there are others, including traditional brokerages like Robinhood (which just announced support for crypto asset trading in five states).
It’s important to note that Coinbase does not support crypto-crypto pairs (e.g. BTC/ETH) and only supports fiat-crypto pairs (e.g. BTC/USD). As a result, the company’s pool of competitors is more limited, as there are hundreds of crypto-crypto exchanges. Binance is the largest crypto asset exchange by volume (with nearly $6B worth of crypto assets exchanged on January 11), but only supports crypto-crypto trading pairs.

Additionally, and as noted above, none of the exchanges mentioned here have strong mobile presences, and only a couple offer brokerage services. Coinbase’s competitors for the most part operate order book exchanges and cater to more experienced traders. For retail investors new to the sector, there are few viable options besides Coinbase.
Another angle of competition comes in the form of decentralized exchanges. 0x is a tokenized protocol for decentralized exchanges initially launched via a $24M ICO, and is gaining steam as decentralized exchanges – like Radar Relay – build on top of it. While more technical and more difficult to use, decentralized exchanges have no central point of attack and therefore offer increased security. Still, activity is limited when compared to major centralized exchanges, and this threat should be considered on a longer time horizon.


## Results - Business Impacts and core metrics

Auditability: mistakes eliminated. Blockchain offers a shared ledger of transactions with full traceability of any assets and associated activity, enabling organizations to "raise levels of confidence in the data they are producing without having to manually validate the data." 
Compliance: risk mitigated. "Compliance brings with it a great deal of risk and damage if mismanaged. Knowing that blockchain can't be tampered with can provide increased confidence in the data." 
Data management: improved product forecasting.  "Blockchain can improve the management of data in data provenance and accuracy through knowing more about digital assets and accompanying data." 

Data security: data breaches prevented. "Blockchain technology makes use of military-level cryptography."
Ownership: improved customer experience. "Blockchain technology can enable true digital ownership of both real-world goods and digital assets by creating improved intellectual property and personalized data profiles, without the need to check the history or current state of the item."

Payments: eliminated overpaying of invoices. "Blockchain technology can draw on the single shared data source to ensure payments are accurate and remove the need to manually audit and track down payments."

Process automation: resources reallocated. "Organizations can use blockchain to look for improvements in efficiency, cost savings and increased worker productivity and retention by shifting the focus of the workforce to one of jobs with higher engagement and satisfaction." 
Reconciliation: eliminated duplicate payments. "Blockchain technology can significantly cut down the overall costs in solving reconciliation while reducing errors and the accumulation of unreconciled items." 
Standardization: improved speed to market. In a blockchain network, multiple organizations "work together in a blockchain system, they must agree on common terms, business logic and business flow as they share access to the same data and apply the same smart contract-enabled business logic."

Track and trace: resource time saved. "Distributed ledger technology allows trading organizations to view each step of the supply-chain process. Each party can verify the current state and trail of the products without depending upon direct communication with others in the network."

Data sharing: enhanced value from data models. "With blockchain, however, trading partners can share real-time data, but also the history of that data and any modifications to it." 
Resiliency: decreased downtime. "Existing in a distributed form, blockchain creates a highly resilient network with multiple shared copies of the data, which mitigates the risk of an isolated attack or incident." 
Transparency: improved incident response rate. "Blockchain technologies' distributed ledger allows all designated parties to view the data in real time. With unlimited transparency, organizations can identify opportunities, improve decision-making and track and trace the outcome of those decisions."

Trust: mitigated business risk. "Trust is being challenged in the digital world, with organizations unable to verify basic essentials. Blockchain helps enable and even automate trust through cryptographically securing information and providing transparency to the state and trail of data." 
Authentication: prevention of attacks by bad actors. "A core function of blockchain technology is its public and private key cryptography, which can serve as a basis for authenticating one user across multiple networks, resulting in increased confidence in the overall network and participants." 
Identity management: improved retention rate. "It no longer makes sense to rely upon physical documents as the only means of establishing the identity of a user or object. Blockchain technology enables enhanced characteristics in how digital identity is both managed and used, while moving beyond the limitations of being operated by one institution."

Marketplace creation: new markets created. "Blockchain technology improves confidence in products and services in the marketplace, while also using a shared ledger, smart contracts and digital assets to facilitate real time peer-to-peer transactions." 

New and enhanced products and services: new product revenue. "New digital assets can exist beyond the umbrella of one organization, company or government."

New and expanded partnerships: new distribution channels. "Many of these partnerships can have automated components as well, through exploiting digital assets and smart contracts."

THE COINBASE EFFECT
All these factors — strong security, regulatory compliance, ease-of-use, and a focus on investment — have enabled Coinbase to emerge as something of a crypto asset kingmaker for investors.


## Recommendations

Coinbase does not support crypto-crypto pairs (e.g. BTC/ETH). I would suggest this be offered to customers as is done by some of their competitors like Binance

Increased acceptance by investors across the world. This might impact their credibility related to security and compliance but they need to find a way out to support all pairs of trading.

Use the same blockchain technology but enable crypto-crypto pairs trading. This is the only available technology so far.
